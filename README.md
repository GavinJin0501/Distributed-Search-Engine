## Summary
> Summarize your implementation, including key challenges you encountered

My implementation comprises `2` new software components, totaling `~390` added lines of code over the previous implementation. Key challenges included `<1, 2, 3 + how you solved them>`.

## Correctness & Performance Characterization
> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation

*Correctness*:
`I pass the given tests and wrotes tests for the in-memory extra features. I also wrote tests for the workflow`

*Performance*:

## Key Feature
> Which extra features did you implement and how?
`I implemented in-memory storage option by adding a field in the config. If it is in-memory, I will skip the process of persisting the intermediate values into the local file system.`

## Time to Complete
> Roughly, how many hours did this milestone take you to complete?

Hours: `12`
